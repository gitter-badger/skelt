## Your original template builder CLI made easy

I thought that coding react and redux were quite boring for me because I had to code a lot by the protocols. I cannot understand why I have to code these things to implement react and redux. I know, there are some CLI for that, and these CLI seems to be powerful tool for developers. You know, however, there are some times you want to break the rules of such CLI. To use such CLI means obeying the terms of such CLI, I think.

So, I am now developping super flexible CLI builder which can make skelton.
